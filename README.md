# Matrix Rain

A fullscreen, interactive Matrix-style rain animation written in Python using Pygame.

Matrix Rain simulates the iconic falling code effect from the Matrix movies, designed for beginners and enthusiasts. The animation is fully interactive: you can pause, adjust speed, trigger mouse-driven glow effects, change color modes, and more. The project is easy to set up, runs in fullscreen, and is packaged as a standalone executable for Linux using PyInstaller.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Matrix Rain, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.x** (required)
- **Pygame** (for graphics)
- **PyInstaller** (for building executables)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

---

## Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to install and set up Matrix Rain:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aerex0/MatrixRain.git
cd MatrixRain
```

### 2. Create a Python Virtual Environment

This is recommended to keep dependencies isolated:

```bash
python3 -m venv matrix_env
source matrix_env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install Pygame inside the virtual environment:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

### 4. Build the Standalone Executable

Use PyInstaller to create a single-file executable:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile matrix_rain.py
```

This generates a standalone executable in the `dist/` folder.

### 5. Set Up the Command Alias

To run Matrix Rain from anywhere using the `matrix` command:

```bash
./alias_setup.sh
source ~/.bashrc   # or source ~/.zshrc if you use Zsh
```

---

## Usage

After installation, launch the Matrix Rain animation by typing:

```bash
matrix
```

### Interactive Features

- **Pause/Resume:** Press `SPACE`
- **Speed Control:** Use `UP` and `DOWN` arrows to speed up or slow down the rain
- **Mouse Glow:** Move the mouse to create a glowing trail
- **Color Mode:** Press `C` to change the rain color mode
- **Exit:** Press `ESC` to close the animation

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **PyInstaller Missing:**  
  Install it with:
  ```bash
  pip install pyinstaller
  ```
- **Pygame Missing:**  
  Install it with:
  ```bash
  pip install pygame
  ```
- **Virtual Environment Not Activated:**  
  Make sure to activate with:
  ```bash
  source matrix_env/bin/activate
  ```
- **Alias Not Working:**  
  Make sure to run:
  ```bash
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  source ~/.zshrc
  ```

| File               | Purpose                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `matrix_rain.py`   | Main script for the Matrix Rain animation |
| `alias_setup.sh`   | Shell script to set up the `matrix` alias |
| `README.md`        | Project documentation and instructions    |

## Optional Tips & Notes

- **Customization:**  
  You can change font size, rain colors, or other effects inside `matrix_rain.py`.
- **Platform:**  
  Matrix Rain is tested on Linux systems.
- **Standalone Executable:**  
  The file generated by PyInstaller (`dist/matrix_rain`) contains everything needed, including Pygameâ€”no need for Python after building.
