# Matrix Rain

A fullscreen, interactive Matrix-style rain animation written in Python using Pygame.

Matrix Rain simulates the iconic falling code effect from the Matrix movies, designed for beginners and enthusiasts. The animation is fully interactive: you can pause, adjust speed, change color modes, and interact with the rain using your mouse. Each column of rain responds individually, and you can create glowing effects by moving your mouse across the screen.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Matrix Rain, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.x** (required)
- **Pygame** (for graphics)
- **PyInstaller** (optional, for building executables)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

---

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aerex0/Matrix_Rain.git
cd Matrix_Rain
```

### 2. (Optional) Create a Python Virtual Environment

This is recommended to keep dependencies isolated:

```bash
python3 -m venv matrix_env
source matrix_env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install Pygame inside the virtual environment (or globally):

```bash
pip install pygame
```

If you want to build a standalone executable, also install pyinstaller:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

### 4. Run Directly

You can run Matrix Rain directly with Python:

```bash
python matrix_rain.py
```

### 5. (Optional) Build a Standalone Executable

Use PyInstaller to create a single-file executable (Linux only):

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --name matrix matrix_rain.py
```

This generates a standalone executable in the `dist/` folder.

### 6. (Optional) Set Up the Command Alias

To run Matrix Rain from anywhere using the `matrix` command:

```bash
./alias_setup.sh
source ~/.bashrc   # or source ~/.zshrc if you use Zsh
```

---

## Usage

After installation, launch the Matrix Rain animation by typing:

```bash
python matrix_rain.py
```
or, if you set up the alias:
```bash
matrix
```

### Interactive Features

**Keyboard Controls:**
- **Pause/Resume:** Press `SPACE` to toggle pause.
- **Speed Control:** Use `UP` and `DOWN` arrow keys to speed up or slow down the falling rain for all columns.
- **Color Mode:** Press `C` to change the rain color mode randomly.
- **Exit:** Press `ESC` to close the animation.

**Mouse Interactions:**
- **Mouse Glow:** Move the mouse anywhere on the screen to create a glowing cyan trail. Rain characters near your mouse will glow and stand out.
- **Column-Specific Glow:** Both the head and tail of each rain stream will glow when near the mouse, creating a dynamic effect as you move.

**Rain Stream Behavior:**
- Each column falls at its own speed and delay, making the rain uneven and organic.
- Columns wrap from the bottom to the top when reaching the end.
- Tail lengths are randomized for natural variation.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **PyInstaller Missing:**  
  Install it with:
  ```bash
  pip install pyinstaller
  ```
- **Pygame Missing:**  
  Install it with:
  ```bash
  pip install pygame
  ```
- **Virtual Environment Not Activated:**  
  Make sure to activate with:
  ```bash
  source matrix_env/bin/activate
  ```
- **Alias Not Working:**  
  Make sure to run:
  ```bash
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  source ~/.zshrc
  ```

## Folder Structure

Here's a quick overview of the key files:

| File               | Purpose                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `matrix_rain.py`   | Main script for the Matrix Rain animation |
| `alias_setup.sh`   | Shell script to set up the `matrix` alias |
| `themes`      | Different matrix raining simulations      |
| `README.md`        | Project documentation and instructions    |

---

## Optional Tips & Notes

- **Customization:**  
  You can change font size, rain colors, or other effects inside `matrix_rain.py`.
- **Platform:**  
  Matrix Rain is tested on Linux systems.
- **Standalone Executable:**  
  The file generated by PyInstaller (`dist/matrix`) contains everything needed, including Pygameâ€”no need for Python after building.
